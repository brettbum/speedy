This provides the means of altering the Parallax Pro theme from StudioPress to add additional sections with and without Parallax background images.

I'm new to Github and wasn't positive of the best way to show this.  I did not provide a copy of the entire theme as the license is held by StudioPress.  My main goal was to show the edits necessary to change the existing theme if you already own a license.  If there is a better, more effective, appropriate way to accomplish this, please let me know!
